- **Filter purchase orders by spend request timeframe** — Use \`spend_start_date\` and \`spend_end_date\` to retrieve POs tied to a specific spend window.  
- **New endpoint: \`POST /reimbursement/mileage\`** — Log and submit mileage reimbursements via API.  
- **Filter transactions by update timestamp** — \`GET /transactions\` now supports the \`updated_after\` filter for incremental syncs.  
- **Search accounting vendors and GL accounts by \`remote_id\`** — Simplifies mapping to ERP systems.  
- **Match bills to purchase orders** — Enables programmatic linkage between bills and POs.  
- **Include \`is_manager\` in user invites** — Supports setting manager status when inviting a user via API.  
- **Filter purchase orders by \`user_id\`** — Use \`GET /purchase-orders\` with \`user_id\` to retrieve POs submitted by a specific user.  
- **\`accounting_date\` now returned in reimbursements** — Available via \`GET /reimbursements\` for improved reconciliation workflows.  
- **New endpoint: \`POST /reimbursements/submit-receipt\`** — Attach receipts directly to reimbursements via API.  
- **Auto-match uploaded receipts using OCR** — \`POST /receipts\` can now automatically associate receipts with matching transactions.  
- **Temporary limit increases** — Use \`PATCH /limits/{limit_id}\` to implement temporary spending limit boosts.

- **Search by accounting field selections** — Filter transactions and bills based on assigned accounting fields for better categorization.  
- **Custom forms support** — Retrieve and manage custom form metadata on Vendors, Purchase Orders, Transactions, and Limits using \`GET\` endpoints.
