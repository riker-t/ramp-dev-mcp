Ramp APIs will return an `x-trace-id` header in all API responses. The `x-trace-id` is particularly helpful for debugging, as it enables correlation between logs, metrics, and the API response, providing greater visibility into how the request was processed.

## Usage

- Include the `x-trace-id` when reaching out to Ramp support for quicker issue resolution.
- Use the `x-trace-id` to track specific requests across different systems and identify potential bottlenecks or failures.
- Make sure to log the `x-trace-id` in your application for easy reference in case you need to troubleshoot any API interactions.

## Example

Every API response includes the trace ID in the headers:

```bash
curl -I https://api.ramp.com/developer/v1/business \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RAMP_API_TOKEN"

# Response headers include:
# x-trace-id: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

When contacting support, always include this trace ID for faster resolution.
