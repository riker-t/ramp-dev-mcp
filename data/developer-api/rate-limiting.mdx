title: Rate Limiting
priority: 4
---

To ensure reliable and equitable access to our API, we enforce rate limiting. By default, API requests are limited as follows:

- **Limit:** 200 requests per 10-second rolling window.
- **Reset Mechanism:** The window operates on a rolling basis, meaning every new request resets the 10-second timer for that particular request.

When the rate limit is exceeded, the API responds with a **429 Too Many Requests** status code. This indicates that further requests should be paused until the limit resets.

## Tips for Handling Rate Limits

- **Implement Backoff Strategies:** When receiving a `429 Too Many Requests` response:
  - Implement exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s) before retrying.
  - Avoid immediate retries, as this could worsen delays.
- **Optimize API Calls:** Consolidate requests wherever possible, such as using batch endpoints or minimizing redundant calls.

## Example Scenario

If you make 200 requests at `10:00:00`, the limit will be reached, and subsequent requests will return a `429` response. If no further requests are made, the limit will reset by `10:00:10`. However, if you continue making requests during the window, the rolling timer will extend accordingly.

## Requesting Higher Limits

If your application requires a higher limit, you can request an increase. To do so:

1. Analyze and document your expected API usage.
2. Contact developer-support@ramp.com with your account details and usage requirements.

Providing clear information about your use case and anticipated volume will help expedite the review process.
