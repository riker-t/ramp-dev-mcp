The Ramp API returns detailed error information in the response body along with standard HTTP status codes. This allows you to quickly diagnose and address issues with your API requests.

## Error Response Format

Here is an example of an error response:

```json
Response Code: 422
Response Contents: {
   "error_v2": {
      "error_code": "DEVELOPER_7001",
      "additional_info": {
         "page_size": [
            "Value must be between 2 and 100"
         ]
      },
      "notes": "",
      "message": "Value must be between 2 and 100"
   },
   "error": {
      "page_size": [
         "Value must be between 2 and 100"
      ]
   }
}
```

## Best Practices for Handling Errors

1. **Inspect HTTP Status Codes**:
   - Use status codes to identify the category of the error (e.g., `4xx` for client errors, `5xx` for server errors).

2. **Utilize the `error_v2` Field**:
   - Parse the `error_code` and `additional_info` to pinpoint the issue and provide actionable feedback in your application.

3. **Log Errors**:
   - Log error responses, including the `x-trace-id` from the response headers, for easier debugging and communication with Ramp developer support.

4. **Implement Retry Logic**:
   - For transient errors (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests` or `5xx`), implement exponential backoff to retry requests.

5. **Provide User Feedback**:
   - Use the `message` field to display clear and concise error messages to users, when applicable.

## Common Error Codes

| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API token |
| `403` | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `422` | Unprocessable Entity - Validation errors |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal Server Error - Server-side issue |
