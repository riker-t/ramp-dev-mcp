## Overview

Ramp's API resources are interconnected through a rich set of relationships that mirror real-world business processes. Understanding these relationships is crucial for building effective integrations, especially when you need to:

- **Plan complex integrations** that span multiple resources
- **Optimize API calls** by understanding data dependencies
- **Build comprehensive reporting** that connects related data
- **Design user interfaces** that reflect business workflows

## How Relationships Appear in Documentation

When viewing any API resource, you'll see interactive relationship indicators next to UUID fields that reference other resources. These indicators show the target resource and relationship type, with clickable links for easy navigation.
