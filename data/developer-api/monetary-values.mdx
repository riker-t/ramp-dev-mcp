title: Monetary Values

In the Ramp API, monetary values are represented by the `currency_code` and `amount`. All `currency_code` values are three-letter acronyms as defined in **ISO 4217** (e.g., USD for US Dollars). There are two representations of the amount:

## Canonical representation (Preferred)

Ramp's preferred method for representing monetary values is **canonical representation**, which uses the `CurrencyAmount` type to group `amount` and `currency_code` together. The `amount` is represented as an integer in the smallest denomination to avoid precision loss.

For example:
- **USD**: $40 is represented as `4000` (since 1 USD = 100 cents)
- **JPY**: ¥5000 is represented as `5000` (since 1 JPY = 1 yen)

```json
{
  "amount": 4000,
  "currency_code": "USD"
}
```

### Currency Precision

To calculate the correct amount for different currencies, the **canonical representation** multiplies the amount by 10 raised to the power of `D`, where `D` is the number of decimal places for the currency. You can find the `D` value for any currency in the [ISO 4217 Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

- **USD, EUR, GBP, etc.**: `D = 2` (i.e., multiply the amount by 100 for cents)
- **JPY**: `D = 0` (i.e., no decimal places)

**Formula:**
```text
Canonical amount = Raw amount * 10^D
```

For example, for USD:
```text
$40 = 40 * 10^2 = 4000 (canonical amount)
```

### Supported Currencies

| Currency | Example Amount (Canonical) | Precision (Decimal Places) |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| USD      | 4000 ($40.00)             | 2                          |
| EUR      | 10000 (€100.00)           | 2                          |
| JPY      | 5000 (¥5000)              | 0                          |
| GBP      | 2500 (£25.00)             | 2                          |

### Schema Definition

Below is the schema definition of `CurrencyAmount` type:

```json
{
   "properties":{
      "amount":{
         "description":"the amount of money represented in the smallest denomination of the currency. For example, when the currency is USD, then the amount is expressed in cents.",
         "type":"integer"
      },
      "currency_code":{
         "default":"USD",
         "description":"The type of currency, in ISO 4217 format. e.g. USD for US dollars",
         "type":"string"
      }
   },
   "required":[
      "amount",
      "currency_code"
   ],
   "type":"object"
}
```

## Legacy representation (Deprecated)

The legacy representation is an older way of representing amounts. Although this method is still supported for backward compatibility, it is **deprecated** and will be replaced in future releases. You should **migrate to the canonical representation** for new development.

```json
{
  "amount": 40.00,
  "currency_code": "USD"
}
```

## Date and Time Format

Date and DateTime are represented using a string that conforms to [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601); UTC is assumed if no timezone offset is specified. For example,

```json
{
  "created_at": "2022-04-28T21:36:29.604020"
}
```
